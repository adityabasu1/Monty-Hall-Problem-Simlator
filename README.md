# Monty-Hall-Problem-Simulator


Code to simulate the Monty Hall Problem (MHP) and verify winning probabilities
   
Run the code with: python3 MHP.py <NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS>
Recommended NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS: 2500-3000 (although the more the merrier)
Approximate run-time for 2500-3000 simulations: 1 minute

We also verify the following facts (using a plot):
(i) probability of winning if you switch = 2/3
(ii) probability of winning if you stick = 1/3
We also verify the following facts using a plot):

Mathematical insight:
Assume (#winning ratio after switching) as a Bernoulli random variable with p = 2/3
or,(#winning ratio after sticking) as a Bernoulli random variable with p = 1/3
The results we get are in accordance with the Law of Large Numbers 
i.e with very high number of simulations, the winning ratio does converge to its expected value
